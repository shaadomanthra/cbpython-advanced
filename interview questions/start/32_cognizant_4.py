# write a program to print highest odd fibonacci number from a given range
# eg: input : 100 , 250 output: 233
# ** important question - asked 5 to 6 times in coding interviews

# write a fibonacci number series
# take a temp varaible to store the odd fibonacii numbers
# exit the loop after 250 (upper limit)
# the last stored number in temp is the answer
